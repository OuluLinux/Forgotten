So we can get data to the kernel, but we can't really get it back.
One solution might be for the event handler to serialise the buffer,
transmit it to the kernel, and then unserialise the *same buffer*.

This means that the kernel can change stuff inline and it'll affect
the state of both sides of the great divide.

I'll get it working using a system call + serialised buffer, then I'll
investigate other methods of integrating into the event system.
