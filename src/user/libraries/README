This subdirectory contains directories for libraries designed to be used by
user applications that don't fall under the "subsystem" banner.

The folder structure is as so:

- libraries
  + name_of_lib (with lib prefix - "libui")
    + include
    + src

The include directory within a library directory contains PUBLIC include files
that will be exposed to applications linking against the library.

The src directory contains the actual source code for the library, as well as
PRIVATE include files that should not be exposed to applications, but are
required within the source code.
