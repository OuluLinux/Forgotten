Clean code:
 - restructure native code in "namespace Com::Native {" way
	- remove "::Native"

Upgrade slow code:
 - Index: too slow search
 - use realloc in all Reserve and Shrink functions


Use meta functions for wrapping native classes like:
 - TimeStop

These classes were copy-pasted from old c++ source.
Use meta for new version of these classes:
 - Callback, etc.
