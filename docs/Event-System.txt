The Forgotten Kernel Event System
================================

Introduction
------------

In order to support event-driven application frameworks and so as not
to burden the kernel with POSIX primitives (such as signals), a fully
generic event handling and dispatching system has been built into Forgotten kernel.

Events are sent asynchronously with no return value or indication that they
have been received or handled. Event subclasses provide `Serialize` and 
`Unserialize` functions that allow the passing of Events over address space
boundaries (see below). Events may be nested - one event may be being handled 
when another is fired. This can continue up to a hard limit, which is 
implementation defined.

API
---

All events must subclass `class Event`;

    class Event {
    public:
        Event(uintptr_t handler_address, bool is_deletable, size_t specific_nesting_level=~0UL);
        virtual ~Event();

        virtual bool IsDeletable();
        virtual size_t Serialize(uint8_t *p_bffer) = 0;
        static bool Unserialize(uint8_t *p_buffer, Event &event);
        static size_t GetEventType(uint8_t *p_buffer);
        uintptr_t GetHandlerAddress();
        size_t GetSpecificNestingLevel();
        virtual size_t GetNumber();
    };

Note that the important functions that *require overriding* are `Serialize`,
`Unserialize` and `GetNumber`. For a full description of each function, see
the documentation.

Each `Event` object can have only one handler address. This cannot be changed at 
runtime; the value is not thread-reentrant. An `Event` can be deletable - if this
is true, when the `Event` is fired it will be immediately deleted. This is useful
for creating 'fire-and-forget' type events, so you don't have to worry about
memory leaks.

So, hypothetically, what if you had an Event that when fired, did a kind of `longjmp` (Probably using the `Processor::SaveState` and `Processor::RestoreState` functions) to some code in the original thread? This could be used as a hard timeout
(in fact, this exact mechanism is implemented in `TimeoutGuard`). There is a problem here - Events can be nested, and you may be inadvertently longjmp'ing over another Event that is partially executed (and possibly preempted).

It is for this reason that the `specific_nesting_level` constructor parameter is implemented. Using this (as opposed to the default value of `~0UL`) constrains the kernel to only run this Event when it is currently at that event nesting level.
